# Mood-Generator
Very basic java script app that generates a mood

Uses vanilla JS

How it works : 

<ul>
  <li>Generates a random number between 0 and the length of the array of moods</li>
  <li>Takes that number and gets that index from the array of moods</li>
  <li>Displays that array in a span</li>
</ul>

// Example
- Random number is generated, it is 2
- The mood at index 2 is Sad
- Sad is displayed in the span with an id of "currentMood"
